# Resume Knowledge Base

A reference of evidence-based resume principles used to evaluate and improve candidate profiles.

## 1. The 6-Second Scan Rule

Recruiters spend an average of 6 seconds on an initial resume scan before deciding to read further or discard.

**What they look for in those 6 seconds:**
- Current/most recent job title and company
- Previous job titles
- Education
- Overall visual clarity and length

**Implications:**
- The top third of page one is prime real estate — put your strongest signal there
- Job titles and company names must be instantly readable (not buried in paragraph text)
- One page for < 10 years experience; two pages max for senior candidates
- Dense walls of text fail the scan — use bullets, whitespace, and clear section headers

## 2. The XYZ Formula (Google's Resume Formula)

Every bullet point should follow the structure:

> **Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]**

**Good:** "Reduced API response time by 40% by migrating from REST polling to WebSocket connections, enabling real-time updates for 50k daily active users."

**Bad:** "Worked on API performance improvements."

**Rules:**
- Lead with a strong action verb (built, reduced, shipped, migrated, led, designed)
- Include a metric whenever possible (%, $, time saved, users impacted, scale)
- Describe the method — what specifically did you do?
- If no metric exists, describe the scope or impact qualitatively

**Strong action verbs:** Architected, Reduced, Shipped, Led, Scaled, Optimized, Designed, Built, Migrated, Automated, Deployed, Increased, Cut, Eliminated, Launched

## 3. Keyword Alignment

Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) scan for keyword matches before a human ever sees the resume.

**Rules:**
- Mirror exact language from the job description (if JD says "microservices", use "microservices" not "service-oriented architecture")
- Required skills in the JD should appear in your resume if you have them
- Place the most critical keywords in experience bullets, not just a skills section
- Don't keyword-stuff — every term must be tied to a real achievement

---

## 4. Skills Section

**What belongs:**
- Technical skills you can speak to in an interview
- Tools/languages explicitly mentioned in the job description (if you know them)

**What doesn't belong:**
- Generic soft skills ("team player", "strong communicator") — these belong in bullets
- Technologies you last touched 8+ years ago unless directly relevant
- Basic tools everyone knows (Microsoft Office, Google Docs, email)

**Format:** Group by category (e.g., Languages, Frameworks, Cloud, Tools). Put the most JD-relevant category first.

---

## 5. Summary / Headline

The summary sits at the top and must answer: *"Why should I keep reading?"*

**Good summary structure:**
- Your professional identity (title/level + domain)
- Your strongest differentiator (a unique skill, scale of experience, or outcome)
- What you're targeting (optional — avoid if obvious from context)

**Good:** "Senior backend engineer with 7 years building distributed systems at scale. Led infrastructure migration serving 2M+ requests/day at Acme Corp. Seeking roles where I can own platform architecture end to end."

**Bad:** "Motivated software engineer with a passion for technology and a proven track record of delivering results in fast-paced environments."

**Rules:**
- Maximum 3 sentences
- No "I" statements
- No generic filler — every word must be earned

---

## 6. Experience Ordering

- Lead with the most relevant role for the target job, not necessarily the most recent
- Within each role, put the strongest/most relevant bullet first
- If a past role is more relevant than the current one, add a brief note or consider a functional format

---

## 7. One Page vs. Two Page

- **< 8 years experience:** One page, aggressively trimmed
- **8–15 years:** One to two pages acceptable
- **15+ years / senior/staff/principal:** Two pages max

**When trimming:**
- Cut roles older than 10–12 years unless uniquely relevant
- Cut bullets that don't differentiate you (e.g., "attended standups", "wrote documentation")
- Cut education details once you have 3+ years of experience (school, degree, year — no GPA unless < 3 years out and > 3.5)

---

## 8. Quantification Heuristics

When the candidate's profile lacks explicit numbers, these proxies are acceptable:

- "Team of N" for team size
- "Codebase of X LOC" for scale
- "Served N users / N requests/day" for system scale
- "Reduced from X to Y" for improvements
- "In N weeks / N sprints" for speed
- "Across N services / N repos" for scope

Never fabricate metrics. If uncertain, use qualifying language ("approximately", "~").

---

## 9. Red Flags to Remove

- Employment gaps longer than 3 months with no explanation
- Job-hopping (< 1 year at multiple consecutive roles) without context
- Generic objective statements ("Seeking a challenging role…")
- References listed on the resume itself
- Photos, graphics, tables (ATS parsers often fail on non-text elements)
- Multiple fonts, colors, or complex layouts that don't survive PDF conversion
- Outdated contact info or a non-professional email address

---

## 10. Format Principles

- **Font:** 10–12pt, standard (Calibri, Garamond, Georgia, Helvetica)
- **Margins:** 0.5–1 inch
- **Section order (standard):** Summary → Experience → Skills → Education
- **Section order (new grad):** Summary → Education → Projects → Experience → Skills
- **Dates:** Right-aligned, consistent format (e.g., "Jan 2021 – Mar 2023")
- **File format:** PDF unless specifically requested otherwise
- **File name:** `FirstName-LastName-Resume.pdf`
